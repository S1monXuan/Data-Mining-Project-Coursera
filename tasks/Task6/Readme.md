# data for task 6
The data could be find via the [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dataminingcapstone/Task6/Hygiene.tar.gz)

- hygiene.dat: Each line contains the concatenated text reviews of one restaurant.

- hygiene.dat.labels: For the first 546 lines, a binary label (0 or 1) is used where a 0 indicates that the restaurant has passed the latest public health inspection test, while a 1 means that the restaurant has failed the test. The rest of the lines have "[None]" in their label field implying that they are part of the testing subset.

- hygiene.dat.additional: It is a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file where the first value is a list containing the cuisines offered, the second value is the zip code, which gives an idea about the location, the third is the number of reviews, and the fourth is the average rating, which can vary between 0 and 5 (5 being the best).
