My personal fav's are the Tso's, peppered chicken, crab cheese bake, deep fried shrimp, and the baked salmon. Their crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and soup are fair. Finally their desert. Unlike most Chinese buffets I've been to this one buckets of ice cream. You serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of Mint Chocolate chip, strawberry, butter pecan, and birthday cake.

I got the stirfry which was okay. I think the crunchy vegetables were the best. The stir fry sauce was a little bland for my liking.

It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it.

I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to).

The food, however, is very authentic, though they don't always have the exact ingredients that you would find in Hong Kong.

The place doesn't have many people eating in it when I've gone usually Chinese people though. Once in awhile the place is quite full, but the best news is they are open EVERY DAY until 9:30. They are not upset when you arrive close to 9pm. Szechuan cooking is quite delightful here and I'll pick it over closer options any day of the week. I'm sorry I haven't Yelped them.

I ordered the house special hot pot.  It had seafood (fish, imitation crab meat, greens, and carrots).  Now as far as hot pot goes, it's a failure.  The food itself was more like seafood soup.

I was looking for a Fish Fillet in Spicy Sauce and a Hot and Sour Soup.  Both were of highest quality.  I was impressed by the taste and the quality of ingredients.  I hate fatty meats and excessive oil, and Lao Ching Hing prepared both dishes to my likening.  I am writing this review because there was hardly anybody in the restaurant when I came in, and I believe this place should be packed.

Everything was decent although not enough to distinguish itself from other Chinese restaurants. Service was great and prices were extremely reasonable. My fave was the rice noodles with beef because it had lots of onions, sprouts and other veggies in it. A little salty for my liking but I liked it nonetheless. I am indifferent if I were to go back.

Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.\",\n",

I also ordered the lunch special fish filet with chili oil.  When it came out I thought I ordered something else.  Instead of fish slices sauteed with vegetables the fish was battered and deep fried.  This would have been fine if the slices weren't cut paper thin and it was super salty.

It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though.

Upon arrival for our reservation the duck was served shortly thereafter with polite and congenial service from a woman I assume is one half of the couple that owns the restaurant. The Shanghai style crepes were good, the scallion was julienned, the hoisin sauce was augmented. It was delicious, but in my opinion it was not a whole duck as ordered and charged for- upon service I asked the woman if it was a whole duck because the sliced breast parts did not seem to be the entire bird. Also, in Chinatown there is a practice of presenting the duck,  carving at table, then whisking away to make a second course from the parts that don't easily lend themselves to rolling in crepes or in buns (some restaurants serve a puffy flat bun and not a crepe) but in our case there was no second course.\",\n",

I tendered my certificate without a word and the staff politely packed up our leftovers, which was most of our meal- that was deliberate.  The bill with tax was 88 bucks and change, and the terms of the certificate included a mandatory 18 percent tip before discount. I don't have a problem with that at all, I always tip on the face value of a meal, not the discount price.  What I don't like however is the habit of owners to assess the tax on the total of the bill prior to discount- I've used certificates at restaurants that used computerized systems and never been taxed on the full price. This restaurant uses hand written tickets that are written entirely in chinese except for the numbers. To add insult to injury, the owner assessed the mandatory tip on the entire amount including the tax.  I know that waitstaff today assume that they are due a tip on the tax, but actually that's quite incorrect traditionally.  When the bill came back it was just shy of eighty dollars after discount.   I don't begrudge restaurant owners trying to keep afloat and make a living, but I don't like it when they pad the bill, and this bill was padded.  That plus our less than a whole duck left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant, and that alone is grounds for me not to return.\",\n",

Advise the server to ask the kitchen to go easy on the salt, and if you're not a fan of MSG, request that they keep it out of your food. Lastly, just order what you want for the meal and if you want extra, order it separately as take-out to avoid having a padded bill.\",\n",

The soup dumplings, while hard to find at many other places, were not remarkable and did not contain much soup. The hot tea was also not great. The decor is nice, but the service was not very good.

It burned just the front of your tongue. We had pork dumplings, cabbage and a pork and garlic dish. I enjoyed all of them. They tasted like the food in China. The cabbage had small shrimp in it that we were not expecting and it was our least favorite dish. The sevice is typical Chinese. The soup came with the beef tendons.

The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid\\'s menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)

I ordered the Water Boiled Beef ... even though it came with a warning to \"some customers\" that it might be too spicy and oily ... and it was delivered bubbling hot with lovely slices of cooked beef and vegetables in a wonderful stock with a chili oil and pepper flavor that was perfectly balanced.  Heat, taste and a great texture all combined for a really wonderful entree.  This is a spicy dish without a doubt, but the warning is unwarranted as it allows the great flavors to come through and when combined with the generous portion of rice served, it is a perfect meal.  My waiter Paul was very excited about the dish and when he found out I had liked it so much, he promised to make me a \"special dish\", not on the menu next time I come in.  That will be very soon!!  The \"Chinese Menu\" is more complex as are the specials on the board coming in.  I am looking forward to another meal here shortly to keep sampling this well executed food at Szechwan Palace.',\n",

I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here. Also, I think everyone, regardless of whether they are Asians or not,  should be given both the menus. Whether I want to eat stomach of pork in sauce or pig\\'s feet, is a choice I would like to make!',\n",

The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place.\",\n",

The water boiled chicken came piping hot in a well made seasoned stock with napa cabbage. Oil and the right amount of  Szechwan peppercorns float on the top of this large enough for two meal,it was addictive and delicious ,not a building hot spice but completely different .

Now for the most attractive part of this dining experience... The amount of delicious food the my friend Michael & I got for just under $30 (The House Combo for 2) was astonishing. For that price we got hot  green tea to keep us warm, 6 pot stickers, 2 spring rolls, 2  full entrees, a big bowl of sizzling rice soup a huge plate of house fried rice with chicken shrimp & pork in it, & to top it all off a bowl full of sweet lychee fruits for desert.

Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiancé favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there.

Anything spicy that you order will be SUPER spicy so be cautious when ordering.  It's authentic enough for me to want to come back here although I haven't tried any other places in the area yet.

The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn\\'t when I questioned her and I didn\\'t figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called \"food no Good\"',\n",

The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes).
